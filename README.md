# Kitedays
Projects related to analysis of wind data for kitesurfing purposes. Wind data is loaded from www.vindsiden.no and saved on local disk (save_files.py)

API
The file kitedaysAPI.py in API folder is a API loading data from www.vindsiden.no to calculate the number of kiteable days in a date interval. Loading wind data from the API of "vindsiden" is time consuming. The wind data therefore needs to be saved locally.
