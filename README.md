# Kitedays
Projects related to analysis of wind data for kitesurfing purposes. Wind data is loaded from www.vindsiden.no, cleaned and saved on local disk (save_files.py)

API: The file kitedaysAPI.py is loading data from www.vindsiden.no to calculate the number of kiteable days in a date interval. Loading wind data from the "vindsiden" API is time consuming. The wind data therefore needs to be saved locally.
