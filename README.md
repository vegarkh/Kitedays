# Kitedays
Projects related to analysis of wind data for kitesurfing purposes. The file kitedaysAPI.py is a API loading data from www.vindsiden.no to calculate the number of kiteable days in a date interval. Loading wind data from the API of "vindsiden" is time consuming. The wind data is therefore saved locally by the file save_files.py such that data can be loaded from local disk.
